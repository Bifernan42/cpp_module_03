# Fourth C++ Assignment  

## Concepts: [Inheritance, Class Hierarchy, Multiple Inheritance, Virtual Functions]  

In this fourth assignment, we had to:  
- Implement a **ClapTrap** class with basic combat mechanics  
- Extend it using **inheritance** to create **ScavTrap** and **FragTrap**, each with unique abilities  
- Ensure **proper construction and destruction chaining** in the class hierarchy  
- Introduce **multiple inheritance** with **DiamondTrap**, combining behaviors from both **ScavTrap** and **FragTrap**  
- Understand **ambiguities in multiple inheritance** and how to resolve them using **virtual inheritance**  

This assignment deepened our understanding of **OOP principles**, particularly **inheritance and polymorphism** in C++.
